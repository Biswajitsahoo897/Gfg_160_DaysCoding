# Count Inversions

## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `arr[]`, find the **Inversion Count** in the array.  
Two elements `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` form an inversion if `arr[i] > arr[j]` and `i < j`.

### Inversion Count
For an array, the inversion count indicates how far (or close) the array is from being sorted:
- If the array is already sorted, the inversion count is `0`.
- If the array is sorted in reverse order, the inversion count is maximum.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input**:  
`arr[] = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]`  
**Output**:  
`3`  
**Explanation**:  
The sequence `[2, 4, 1, 3, 5]` has three inversions: `(2, 1)`, `(4, 1)`, `(4, 3)`.

---

### Example 2:
**Input**:  
`arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`  
**Output**:  
`0`  
**Explanation**:  
As the sequence is already sorted, there is no inversion count.

---

### Example 3:
**Input**:  
`arr[] = [10, 10, 10]`  
**Output**:  
`0`  
**Explanation**:  
As all the elements of the array are the same, there is no inversion count.

## Constraints
- `1 â‰¤ arr.size() â‰¤ 10^5`
- `1 â‰¤ arr[i] â‰¤ 10^4`

---

## Approach
1. **Brute Force**:  
   - Compare each pair of elements `(arr[i], arr[j])` where `i < j` and count the number of inversions.  
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)`.

2. **Optimized Approach (Merge Sort)**:  
   - Use a modified merge sort algorithm to count inversions during the merge step.  
   - **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)`.

---

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)` (using merge sort).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` (for temporary arrays used in merge sort).
